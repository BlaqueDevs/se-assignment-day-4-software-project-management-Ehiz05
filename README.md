## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery builds organisational reputation, satisfaction and profitability.
Meeting deadlines means taking responsibility by understanding workflow, order of precedence and prioritizing.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
a. Control model adoption - Repetitive cost control technique help organizations adopt standards for evaluation and productivity levels.
Reduces overspending. Cost controls help project managers keep their budget on track.
Risk mitigation - By setting a risk allowance for unforeseen costs.
b. By effectively engaging stakeholders avoid delays that could be detrimental.
Also, with a detailed, articulated project plan that accurately reflect the scope, timeline, and resources requiredbudget overruns can be avoided.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall is a traditional project management concept, involving a linear flow while Agile embraces an iterative process.
It involves rapid actions and great flexibility.
Advantages of Waterfall : It’s easily understandable for the team and to know what’s expected of them.
                          Stipulated budgeting is applicacable.
Disadvantages           : It’s a challenge to identify roadblocks and dependencies that could delay work.
                          It is difficult for stakeholders to track milestones until the end of a project or until a final product is complete.
                         
Advantages of Agile     : The planning process is collaborative for the whole team.
                          Process is mutable to avoid roadblocks or stalled work.
Disadvantages           : Agile teams may lack procedural endorsement they require from management and business owners.
                          There is skill shortage in terms of employees who are experienced with agile methods.

                      
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile benefits:
Creative projects  - Projects that involve a lot of creative problem-solving benefit from an agile approach as it allows for more
                     experimentation and innovative thinking.
Technical projects - Agile provides teams with structural approach in formulation and creation of complex software or products.
Example: Agile is more appropriate for projects where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way. 

Waterfall benefits:
Conventional projects - Predictable deliverables based on set deadlines.
Effective policy implementation - This is evident in rigid quality control measures.
Example: Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and strict deadlines.
